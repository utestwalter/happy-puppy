# Happy Puppy — Dog Breed Predictor

Happy Puppy is a small convolutional neural network (CNN) project built for fun and learning purposes.

The model can recognize two dog breeds — French Bulldog and Siberian Husky — based on a photo.  
If the uploaded image does not match these breeds, the model gently informs the user.

This project was created as a home experiment to explore building, training, and deploying a small neural network from scratch.
